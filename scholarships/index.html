						<p class="sec-title">Talent Awards</p>
						<p class="sec-desc">
							The	Department	of	ART Talent	Award	is	a	tuition	award	based	upon	the	quality	and	caliber	of	student
							work.	The	Talent	Award	is	available	for	all	incoming (high	school	&	pre-majors) and	continuing	students
							in	the	Department	of	ART.	Programs	included	Drawing,	Painting,	Printmaking,	New	Genre,	Ceramics	&
							Sculpture.	Awards	are	deposited	into	the	student’s	University	account	for	tuition	and	are	not	given	as
							cash	awards. They	will	be	applied	to	student’s	tuition	as	soon	as	the	student	is	registered	for	the
							required	number	of	credit	hours,	(i.e.	Fall/Winter	– 14	hours;	Sp/Su	– 6	hours).
						</p>
						<p class="sec-title">Eligibility</p>
						<p class="sec-desc">
							This	application	is	for	all	students	currently	in	the	program,	and	high	school	students	applying	for	fall
							semester.
							<br><br>
							The	granting	of	a	Talent	Award	does	not	mean	a	student	has	been	admitted	to	the	University.	All
							University	admission	requirements	must	be	met	before	an	award	can	be	granted.	Acceptance	to	the
							Department	of	ART through	a	Talent	Award	will	require	those	accepted	students to	complete	the
							Freshman	Core	Program	(ART	226,	ART	114,	ART	115,	ART	133)	within	the	first	year	before	they	can
							move	on	in	their	program.
							<br><br>
							The	student	must	be	registered	for	a	minimum	number	of	credit	hours	during	the	semesters	for	which
							the	award	is	granted.	Fall/Winter	– 14	hours	each	semester;	Spring/Summer	– 6	hours	each	term.
							Anyone	on	probation,	warning,	etc.	will	not	be	permitted	to	receive	talent	award	(scholarship)	funds.
						</p>
						<p class="sec-title">General Information</p>
						<p class="sec-desc">
							The	deadline	for	Talent	Award	Applications	is	12	midnight	on	the	due	date,	February	1st.	See	the
							secretary	for	actual	dates	or	visit	the	talent	award	application	on art.byu.edu. Applicants	are	required	to
							submit	a	portfolio	online.	The	results	of	the	review	will	not	be	complete	until	April.	Students	will	receive
							a	letter	letting	them	know	whether	or	not	they	received	the	award	money.	We	cannot	tell	students	over
							the	phone.
							<br><br>
							The	Talent	Awards	are	for	the	semester(s)	chosen	to	receive	the	award	(i.e.,	Spring/Summer	or
							Fall/Winter	semesters).	Students	must	indicate	the	semester(s)	for	which	they	are	applying	on	the
							Talent	Award	Application	form.	Students	may	indicate	more	than	one	semester.
							<br><br>
							Please	be	aware	that	awards	CANNOT	be	transferred	between	Spring/Summer	and	Fall/Winter
							semesters.	If	a	student	receives	an	award	for	Spring/Summer	semester(s)	the	student	should	plan	on
							attending	school	during	Spring/Summer.
							<br><br>
							Talent	Awards	are	not	renewable.	Students	should	reapply	for	a	Talent	Award	each	February	for	the
							following	year.
							<br><br>
							Online	portfolios	will	be	carefully	reviewed;	therefore,	considerable	attention	should	be	given	to	the
							portfolio	composition.	The	portfolio	should	contain	no	more	than	10 items	of	work.
							Results	of	the	Talent	Award	review	are	announced	via	mail	during	the	month of	April.	The	Department
							of	ART usually	has	an	Awards	Night	to	recognize	those	students who	received	the	Talent	Awards.	Please
							be	aware	you	may	get	an	email	inviting	you	to	the	Awards	Night	before	you	get	a	letter	letting	you	know
							if	you	got	the	Talent	Award.	If	you	get	an	invitation	please	plan	on	attending	the	Awards	Night	if	you
							can.
							<br><br>
							All	incoming	students	and	continuing	students	are	required	to	submit	no	more	than	10 pieces	of	work
							which	represent	the	student’s	best	work.	Below	is	a	brief	statement of	what	each	area	expects	to	see	in
							an	incoming	student	online	portfolio	or	actual	work	portfolio.	This	is	not	meant	to	be	comprehensive.	If
							you	have	any	other	questions	on	the	portfolio	requirements	please	check	with	the	ART secretaries	in
							E509	Harris	Fine	Arts	Center.
