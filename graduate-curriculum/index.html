						<p class="sec-title">MFA in Art</p>
						<p class="sec-desc">The MFA is the recognized terminal degree for creative artists. It is a 60 credit full-time
							program with rigorous reviews, culminating in the graduate student's solo exhibit. The
							MFA in art, is dedicated to generating artists with significant skills and understandings
							that can influence the discipline. In alignment with current trends in art, the program
							accommodates and nurtures students working in any medium or discipline, including but
							not limited to: Painting, Drawing, Printmaking, Ceramics, Sculpture, Photography,
							Video, Performance, Installation, Digital and New Media.<br><br>From a letter we send to students:<br><br>
							We are convinced that our program will challenge you, develop your skills, broaden your
							philosophical insight, cultivate your personal viewpoint, and increase your art-making
							potential.<br><br>The program at Brigham Young University benefits from the wealth of a well-rounded,
							spiritual approach to learning. We have excellent physical facilities in each of the areas
							of study. The geographic isolation of Provo, Utah, located in the midst of the Rocky
							Mountains, is a pleasant experience, and is complemented by a world class museum on
							campus, which has a steady stream of national and international exhibitions. An active
							departmental agenda of national and international travel further compliments the small
							town profile of Provo.

						<p class="sub-title">Degrees</p>
						<p class="sec-title">MA in Art Education</p>
						<p class="sec-desc">The MA in Art Education is a cohort program intended for teachers who desire graduate
							study in curriculum development and additional content and skills in the disciplines of a
							comprehensive art program. A masters degree prepares students to pursue a PhD or
							EdD in art education if that is their intention. The MA in art education can also contribute
							to K-12 licensure requirements for graduate students who are interested in teaching art.
							In addition to reviewing research literature in art education, this program has a rigorous
							studio practice component designed to integrate teaching and artistic practice. It is a
							four-semester, two-summer term, 36-hour program designed for practicing art educators
							as an alternative to a full-time residency on campus program. Most classes meet on
							Friday evenings or Saturdays to accommodate professionals working in schools.
