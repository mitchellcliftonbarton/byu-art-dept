					<p class="sec-title">Ceramics</p>
					<p class="sec-desc">BYU ceramics is a broad based program combining essential skills with critical art thinking.
						 Students are mentored to learn the traditions of ceramics and to expand upon these to arrive at original solutions.
						 <br><br>
					 	 Students have access to 9 electric kilns, 2 down draft gas kilns, a shuttle kiln, a gas fired raku kiln, an updraft gas kiln,
						 a wood fired train kiln, a soda kiln and a salt kiln. Students also have access to a complete glaze room and materials room as
						 well as a pug room for recycling and formulating clay. The studio has 20 electric wheels, a kick wheel and a slab roller. BFA
						 and MFA ceramic students are granted individual studio spaces and storage. Former students include an NCECA board member and
						 an NCECA emerging talent artist. Our students continue to exhibit nationally and abroad with many opportunities to exhibit and
						 travel during our program.
						 <br><br>
						 Students are involved in every aspect of the ceramic process including opportunities to build and fire kilns according to their
						 needs. We have an open relationship with the sculpture area and hot glass shop so that materials, methods and equipment from both
						 areas can serve students in their artistic practice.

					<p class="sec-title">New Genre</p>
					<p class="sec-desc">
						Our New Genre courses allow students to explore non-traditional approaches to
						art making including installation, video, digital, sound, performance, and everything in
						between. Beginning with an overview of the histories of these practices and an in-depth
						examination of noteworthy contemporary work, students gain critical knowledge and expand
						their sense of possibility. Through these courses students learn to prioritize their ideas and to
						find the best means by which to activate them.

					<p class="sec-title">Painting/Drawing</p>
					<p class="sec-desc">As central to the studio curriculum of the Department of Art, painting and drawing prepares
						 students to engage in the broader visual culture by focusing on contemporary issues and methodologies as related
						 to investigations of more traditional questions and problems. The program is unique in its ability to provide
						 students with strong visual and conceptual reasoning skills critical in each individual student's search for
						 identity and place among their peers and other professionals.

					<p class="sec-title">Photography</p>
					<p class="sec-desc">
						Through our photography courses we provide students with the technical
						knowledge and the means to explore the ever-expanding range of applications of the
						photographic image within contemporary art. Students are introduced to key artists,
						movements, and related theory, and are encouraged to think critically about the role of
						photography within culture.

					<p class="sec-title">Printmaking</p>
					<p class="sec-desc">Printmaking in the BYU Department of Art is seen more as a means of artistic expression rather
						than a meticulous technical process for mass-producing pictorial objects. Students are
						encouraged to first attain proficiency with a variety of print mechanisms and then develop
						conceptual reinterpretations of the ever-expanding medium. It is an objective of the print area to
						cultivate a more self-initiated approach that innovates and redraws the boundaries of the
						contemporary print. This objective is enhanced by: one-on-one attention and participation in
						individual and group critiques, access to the print collections at the BYU Museum of Art, visiting
						artist lectures and demonstrations, occasions to participate in collaborative exchange portfolios,
						and opportunities to participate in group activities that stimulate connections with other
						disciplines.

					<p class="sec-title">Sculpture</p>
					<p class="sec-desc">Sculpture students will explore a broad range of contemporary and traditional sculptural
						practice through a rigorous investigation of concepts and materials.  They will develop technical mastery,
						creative problem-solving, personal sensitivities and critical self-awareness about their own work as they participate
						in a curriculum that concentrates on a blend of theory and practice.  The program embraces new technologies and
						emerging genres on a foundation of tradition sculptural methodology.  Students will participate in individual
						and group critiques in a studio environment that is both stimulating and supportive.  They will become informed,
						critical-thinking artists, that are engaged in relevant dialogues within contemporary art.
